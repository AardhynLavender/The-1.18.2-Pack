# The-1.18.2-Pack
A curated collection of minecraft mods from `1.12.18` for a private server
## Installation
requires: `Minecraft 1.18.2` `Curse Forge Launcher`
- In the **Minecraft** section in CurseForge, select the `Create Custom Profile`, then `import` in the popup.
- Select the `*.zip` to import the profile. ( *There is no need to decompress the directory.* )
## Mod Updates
For those downloading the pack to join the server... please don't update any mods ( unless they're client only mods you've added, such as `FastCraft` ) as this will make your version incompatable with the server.
