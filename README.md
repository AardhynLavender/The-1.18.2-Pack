# The 1.18 Pack
A curated collection of minecraft mods from `1.18.2` for a private server.
### Installation
Requires: `Java` `Minecraft Java 1.18.2` `Curse Forge Launcher`
- In the **Minecraft** section in **CurseForge**, select the `Create Custom Profile`, then `Import` in the popup.
- Select the `*.zip` to import the profile. There is no need to decompress the directory.
### Mod Updates
Please don't update any mods in your copy of pack (unless they're "client only" mods you've added, such as `FastCraft`, `Inventory Tweaks`, `Optifine`, etc.) as this will make your version incompatable with the server.

The admin will update the mods both periodically. Check the Discord server for pack updates.
### Known Issues
Like many packs, the controversial `Optifine` mod has conflicts with some of the mods included (`Twilight Forest`, for instance). 

I've bundled `Rubidium` to replace it best I can. And included `Dynamic Lighting` for hand-held illumination, and `Oculus` for shaders.
